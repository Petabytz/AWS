# MEAN stack
Mean stack refers to the collection of technologies which are the collection of JavaScript used to develop web applications. 
Mean Stack has given a modern approach of web development which runs on every tier of your application. Mean is a combination 
of a group of technologies synergizing well together and Mean stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js”. 
The Node.js saves us from learning a separate language as it allows us to use JavaScript on the frontend as well as the backend. 
In a mean stack with NoSQL, nature of MongoDB you can build a product with clear attributes, and without worrying about migrations
you can change and alter the data layers.

Mean is a simple rearrangement of initial letters of a group of technology. Upgrading the technology and switching the base 
platform from an OS (Linux) to JavaScript runtime has helped achieve OS independence.

AngularJS runs on smart phones, tablets, laptops, desktop and even smart TVs, so it is not only centered towards mobiles and does
not treat mobile devices as a second-class citizen. The stack is basically a set of languages and technologies used to develop 
sites or applications by the developers.

You can easily write comprehensive test suites for your Mean app with world-class texting frameworks such as JasmineJS, KarmaJS,
and MochaJS. Mean is an application completely written on JavaScript technologies.
