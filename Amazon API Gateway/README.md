## What Is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale.
API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. 
As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications (apps). 
Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers. For more information, see Who Uses API Gateway?.

API Gateway creates REST APIs that:

   * Are HTTP-based.

   * Adhere to the REST protocol, which enables stateless client-server communication.

   * Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

API Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that:

   * Adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server.

   * Route incoming messages and based on message content.
